<title>CNIT-132 - Homework 1</title>



<h1 style=text-align:center>CNIT-132 Homework 1</H1>
<p>In this homework we will be changing this code to be a valid code in HTML5.</p>
<p>We will probably need to change a lot of details around the code and the basic idea of this Homework is to learn how to use the validator from W3C.</p>

This is an old boat, probably an old ship. One of those types used to transport heavy cargo in the old times?!?! Of course this picture is not real, but you can imagine a big boat made basically of wood and using the main power of the wind! Remember that this picture needs to be uploaded to the Hills Server (your account) together with this file you are modifying, otherwise, the picture will not be shown!
<p>You will be able to change a little bit the content of the two paragraphs below to insert the links requested to make sense when reading the content.
<p>The link to be inserted here should open in a new window or tab.</p>

     <p>My name is Philip Burkart. I lived in China for 6 years. While in China, I completed a degree in teaching Mandarin. After that, I moved back to America and joined the National Guard. I eventually became a Green Beret, which was my life for 5 years. I currently work in software sales. I own 5 properties, one of which I am converting into a small coffee shop. </p>

<p>I'm attending this class for a couple reasons. I like to build things. Second, I'm trying to create a back-up skill for myself in case I ever want to change careers. </p>

<h2>Subtitle of our page</h2>
<p>It's funny to see this page being upgraded<br>
We will be dealing with a lot of details in this code<br>
and that's the idea of this exercise!</p>
<section>
<p>At least I am using one new HTML5 tag - the section tag. Not sure if I am using it correctly!</p>
</section>
<p>I am trying to build an unordered list here below. Would you be able to help me?</p>
<ul>
<li>- planning a web page</li>
<li>studying the target audience</li>
<li>following standards when coding</li>
