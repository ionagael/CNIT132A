    <p><span class="big-initial"><b><i>M</i></b></span>y life as a web developer has been pretty much amazing! I started developing web pages when there was no CSS to be used, and all formatting was done using HTML tags that are now considered deprecated. For example: <b>&lt;font&gt;, &lt;center&gt;</b>.</p>

    <h2>Using CSS</h2>
    <p><span class="big-initial"><b><i>W</i></b></span>hen CSS was created, the idea was to move formatting from the HTML document to a separate file, so HTML would focus on content and formatting would be handled externally.</p>

    <p><span class="big-initial"><b><i>W</i></b></span>his standard has been supported by W3C (<b>World Wide Web Consortium</b>), which sets web development standards.</p>

    <h2>End of this exercise</h2>
    <p><span class="big-initial"><b><i>A</i></b></span>t the end of this exercise, you will move the formatting into embedded CSS using the <b>&lt;style&gt; tag</b>. This will clean the HTML without changing the visual style.</p>

    <p><span class="big-initial"><b><i>T</i></b></span>his is a link to <a href="http://www.ccsf.edu" target="_blank">City College website</a>. After you visit this page, the link should turn blue.</p>
